# Pattern Printer

Hi! This is a Java CLI program that allows you to create variations of the same pattern based on your input. You can specify the number of rows for the pattern and also provide a custom character to create your pattern with.

## Usage

To use the Pattern Printer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory. If you're running this in your terminal, you will have to navigate to where the Java files live. i.e., `patternPrinter/src/main/java`.

4. Either run this in your favourite IDE or use the terminal.

5. If you're using the terminal, compile the java files using the command: `javac *.java`

6. Run the program using the command: `java Main`

7. The program should then run, and you can now follow through the program prompts
